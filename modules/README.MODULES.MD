# How do Modules work?

You can add your own custom module in this directory, see the other examples, and define the .env vars in the .env file in this directory.

It is also possible to add other pip packages using requirements.txt in this directory.


### NOTE
```
Please note most modules in this directory are AI generated and may not work as expected.
The goal is to implement an API spec convertion tool to custom pip packages.
